  In this example, let's pretend that there was a huge outburst at a very important database for the company. The problems start to appear fast as the whole support department is completely shut down. Frank Gato from this department decides to issue an urgent ticket as soon as possible.<br>
  From his Tickets tab, he clicks on Create new ticket.
